## ROUGH Journey Documentation:
- Encounter with Embedded Javascript templating language
    - Gaining more experience in thinking compartmentally and in terms of reusable components
    - Appreciation for the efficiency provided by templating languages. 
    - Experience with another templating language; noticing similarities with this and mustache and Liquid
- Tutorial wanted to use Bootstrap, but I just encountered Tailwind and wanted to stick with that:
    - Learned about how to install Tailwind via npm, how to initialize a project and build it out. 
    - Learned setup a project setup workflow for myself and practiced running through this. 
    - This provided another useful encounter with installing packages, configuring those packages, wild card file path notation and glob patterns, creating package scripts and naming them appropriately. 
    - Practiced using Tailwind by first creating a layout with just CSS and then using the same HTML structure recreating the layout with Tailwind. 
    - Better grasp of when to use Tailwind and when to use CSS; appreciation for how quickly one can style a layout with Tailwind. 
- Gained a much better understanding of the express.static middleware, how it works, how to use it to serve up files not within the public folder. 
- More experience building Express servers with multiple endpoints; more experience in middleware and utilizing packages and reading documentation
